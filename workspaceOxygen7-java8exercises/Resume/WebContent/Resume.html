EXPERIENCE

ClearChoice Tech, NY
May 2018 – Present
Technical Software Development Manager/Lead Developer

Leading C2C and C2B web and mobile development projects. Technologies being used for these projects are Node.js, ReactNative, ReactJs, MongoDB, Java (Spring Boot), Eureka, MySQL and Amazon Web Services. Performed competitor, requirements & technology analysis. Helped with the business Model. Managing the project and the overseas development team. 

1-	Created numerous Java Spring Boot middle tier micro-services for processing customer requests. ‘Database’ service uses Spring Data JPA with MySQL and returns a set of specialists based on user criteria (specialist type, zip code etc.). ‘Process Specialists’ micro-service calls the ‘database service’ by name (is configured on Eureka) to fetch a set of specialists along with their reviews using Google API. Another service processes appointment data. Spring Boot was used to develop the Rest Services, Netflix Eureka for service registration & discovery and requests were delegated to the micro-services using Netflix Zuul. Docker-ized the micro-services for development, QA, and production. Docker-ized micro-services and Eureka were deployed to AWS EC2 instances (ECS optimized AMI). MySQL was configured on RDS for production. 
Several Amazon Web Services were utilized namely; ECR, ECS/Fargate & EC2 (Security & Target Groups, Elastic IPs, Application Load balancer, Auto Scaling Groups & Launch Configurations., custom AMIs), VPC (Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateways), SES, WorkMail, Route 53, IAM & Certificate Manager, S3. Also utilized AWS cli & machine. 
Configured one Eureka server per AWS zone to handle the zone failures. Used route53 to setup the domain & SSL certificate, resulted in a single URL for the client applications and services. This setup was replicated to other region as the secondary setup for failover & disaster recovery (on Route53). Setup Docker containers to auto start (unless stopped) upon EC2 Instance launch.  Wrote a python script and included on the EC2 Launch Configuration to auto assign Elastic IP to the EC2 instances. Acquired horizontal scaling (adds or removes EC2 instances as per load requirements). 
We used Route53 with EIPs & auto-scaling (setup min-max # of instances) for micro-services on Eureka. For the website, we used Classic Load balancer on Route53 with Auto-scaling group. 

2-	Worked on a PHP web development project. Performed competitor, requirements & technology analysis. Assisted with the business Model. Engaged with overseas developer team. Utilized PHP, MySQL, Java, JavaScript, Node.js & CSS in this effort.

McGraw-Hills, Capital IQ NY, NY
Jan 2012-Aug 2015
Team Lead
Working in the SOA (Service Oriented Architecture and Integration) group; SOA tools consist of Aurea Actional, Sonic MQ & ESB, Oracle WebLogic JMS, Forum Systems XML Gateway and SunOne webserver.  SOA infrastructure is setup in the DMZ and internal network tiers, external services hit the web tier and upon security clearance pass into the internal tiers. This position requires advanced development; inter personal, problem solving, Linux, networking and infrastructure knowledge (load balancers, firewalls, connectivity etc.).
Development: Throughout my tenure with the organization, I have developed numerous SOAP, Rest Based and ESB Services and numerous POC applications. Handled full project life cycles by playing a role of lead developer, business analyst, inter-team liaison, deployment architect and mentor to service consumers (provide sample code, POC & guide development of service client).
	
WorldPay: is a third party vendor that enables e-commerce applications to accept online credit card payments. WorldPay provides an enhanced layer of client data security.  SOA has switched their third party vendor from Clear Commerce to WorldPay. This change was required by Corporate to comply with Payment Card Industry standard (PCI), a directive aimed at reducing credit card fraud. PCI compliance mandates that no credit card holder’s private information should be stored or pass through McGraw-Hill networks, using this new service the client is redirected to WorldPay site to enter the credit card information.   WorldPay service is SOAP based WebLogic web service (uses java API JAX-WS) which utilizes many xml based technologies (XSLT transformation, schema, DTD, WSDL, marshalling, un-marshalling etc.) Result: This switch made SOA service & platform PCI compliant in turn secured the company from legal liability in case of cyber-attack.

1.	Developed a good understanding of WorldPay interface, gathered requirements and conducted business analysis. Created a requirements document. Acquired a written corporate approval on the PCI compliance. 
2.	Created a pass through web service as POC that enabled submission of credit card transactions to WorldPay (takes an xml string and returns an xml string).  Also designed SOA request flow (Client > Actional > WebLogic> Forum > WorldPay)
3.	Mapped current credit card web service operations with the World Pay equivalent and provided additional functionality as per client request 
4.	Released several versions of the WorldPay web service; developing of web service entailed creating a new XSD schema off of WorldPay DTD and new WSDL (contract first), marshalling, un-marshalling, numerous XSLT transformation scripts etc. 
5.	Provided a web service client sample to clients and also provided technical guidance to create an OAM tokenized web service client 
6.	Analyzed SOA infrastructure resources to provide highly available service deployment. Architected and created a high availability deployment architecture diagram, configured infrastructure for high availability including opening Firewalls 
7.	Deployed the service on to SOA infrastructure and supported the clients during production release
Geolocation: For all incoming Rest or Soap requests we utilized an internal soap service named ‘geolocation’ (not the google geolocation) to ascertain client request origin location for security. This service takes an IP address as the input and provides the location and related information. This service utilizes IpInfoDB geolocation database to get the location information. Oracle Coherence Cache was used and dependencies were managed using Maven repository. I developed an equivalent Rest Based service, tested and deployed in all SOA environments. Result: This was a tech simplification project for easier maintenance. 
Infrastructure skills: Setup two new data centers with the SOA application stack on Linux platform. Lead various service migration projects; first migrated Sonic messaging applications from one data center to the newly built data center then a year later; migrated applications from Sonic to WebLogic JMS; migrated external facing web services from Forum Systems (XML Gateway)7 to 8. Installed new security world on Forum and setup/tested all services from scratch for Production and DR data centers (after one of the boxes died). These migration projects entailed development of Sonic and WebLogic JMS consumer and producer applications, setting up SOA infrastructure, opening firewalls, setting up JMS resources, providing technical support to clients and client team coordination. On-boarded numerous new SOAP and Rest Based services on to SOA infrastructure for governance and security. Result: Provided SOA services to Capital IQ (newly acquired); SOA helped secure resources, acquired reuse, helped integrate heterogeneous technologies all without additional cost & effort.  
Architectural activities: Participated in architectural activities & decisions prior to setting up SOA infrastructure in new data centers for newly acquired company Capital IQ. Lead messaging platform product research and evaluation and selected WebLogic JMS as the new messaging standard. Conducted performance analysis on Forum Systems and Sonic MQ. Result: Invalidated Forum System performance client complaints. Helped setup a new messaging standard which reduced cost of maintaining Sonic license and product support.   
Rest Service versioning: Researched, analyzed, compared and contrasted rest web service versioning techniques (for example URI based vs via Accept Header etc.), came up with pros and cons, identified service contract breaking and non-breaking changes and suggested a versioning solution for SOA governed rest services based on SOA tools and infrastructure. Came up with a hybrid solution; include version info in the URI for major version (contract breaking changes) and in the HTTP Accept header for minor non-breaking changes and content negotiation. Conducted a POC; developed a sample Java Rest service which (returns various type of contents, Json, XML etc.)  & created an Actional Java interceptor and deployed to SOA infrastructure, intercepted the HTTP service request using the Interceptor and forwarded the request to the appropriate service version. Created a guide for developers on how to best make changes to the service without breaking the contract and how to handle breaking changes to the contract & data. Created a document for Architect review and finally presented PPT presentation to the entire Architecture group. Result: Established a versioning solution for SOA governed rest services.
Leadership & interpersonal skills: Lead and trained junior developers and interns with various development, infrastructure and migration projects. Participated in new team member hiring process, conducted technical interviews. Availed several opportunities of making technical presentations to public groups and management. Throughout my role as a lead, I practiced collaboration, communication and encouragement. I established trust and relations with the clients by providing end to end technical support and resolving their technical issues under tight deadlines. In 2012 I won a Gold award for innovation week (developed a soap based web service). Wrote an article for the Technology Newsletter related to WorldPay development project. 
Support & Problem Solving: Provided production and non-production support to SOA clients throughout my tenure which entailed solving complex technical issues under tight deadlines. Single handedly performed production disaster recovery during the storm Sandy in 2012.
